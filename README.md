# Crypilot

Crypilot is a tool for precisely describing and validating cryptic
crossword clues. It's a hobby project aimed at exploring the structure
and logic behind cryptic crosswords.

## Current Features

- Data structures for representing various types of cryptic clues
  (e.g., Anagrams, Containers, Deletions)
- Utility functions for string normalization and manipulation specific
  to cryptic crosswords
- Basic validation of clue structures and answers
- Support for combination clues and double solutions

## Project Structure

- `clues.py`: Defines the main clue types and their structures
- `clue_text.py`: Handles combination clues and clue text processing
- `cryptic_strings.py`: Provides utility functions for string
  manipulation and validation
- `solutions.py`: Implements solution types, including double
  solutions

## Status

This project is in its early stages and is primarily for
experimentation and learning. It's not yet ready for practical use in
solving or generating full cryptic crosswords.
